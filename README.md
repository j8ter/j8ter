- 👋 Hi, I’m @j8ter
- 👀 I’m interested in malware analysis, reverse engineering and threat hunting
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, then C, then malware analysis and reverse engineering (currently halfway through Learn Python 3 The Hard Way)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing yet? Stil learning, so not much of a contributor :)
- 📫 How to reach me: check out my own Gitea-instance (<a href="code.joostagterhoek.nl">code.joostagterhoek.nl</a>) or socials (social.joostagterhoek.nl).
