- 👋 Hi, I’m @j8ter
- 👀 I’m interested in malware analysis, reverse engineering and threat hunting
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, then C, then malware analysis and reverse engineering (currently halfway through Learn Python 3 The Hard Way)
- 💞️ This account is currently to read code, gathering SOC and incident response tools, etc.
